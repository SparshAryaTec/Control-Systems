This mobile phone detector can sense the presence of an activated mobile phone from a distance of four to five metres. So it can come handy in an examination hall or meetings where mobile phones are not permitted. Consider a situation where you donâ€™t want to be disturbed by the phone rings or messages or SMSes,etc but at the same time you expect important calls at times. In this case this device is also very useful. The circuit can detect incoming and outgoing calls, SMSes, Internet and video transmissions even if a mobile phone is kept in silent mode. When it detects an RF signal from an activated mobile phone, its LED starts blinking and continues to blink until the signal stops.
